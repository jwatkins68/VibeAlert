ECE 4180 Final Project - Echo Location Device (VibeAlert)

Our echo location devices uses the HC-SR04 Sonar Sensor to detect the distance of unanimous object in front of the user. When the user enters a specific range away from any object in front of them, the echo location device will sound an alarm sound - using a speaker - and alert the user with vibration – using the grove vibration motor - for the hearing impaired. If the user enters a closer range to the object in front of them the vibration will become continuous, and the alarm sound will become more intense.​
