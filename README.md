# VibeAlert
ECE 4180 Final Project - Echo Location Device (VibeAlert)

Our echo location devices uses the HC-SR04 Sonar Sensor to detect the distance of unanimous object in front of the user. When the user enters a specific range away from any object in front of them, the echo location device will sound an alarm sound - using headphones - and alert the user with vibrations – using the grove vibration motor. This device is intended for the hearing impaired. If the user enters a close range to the object in front of them, the alarm sound and vibration will become intense.

<!--- Picture of the Final Product --->
VibeAlert is a device designed to empower and enhance the mobility of visually impaired individuals. It is a compact tool that serves with the purpose of being a reliable companion for navigating the world with confidence and safety.​

<!--- Block Diagram --->
The VibeAlert uses four I/O devices - SD Card Reader, HC-SR04 Sonar Sensor, a Speaker, and  Grove Vibration Motor. The block diagram of these devices can be seen in Figure 1. We implemented a battarty pack so that the breadboard can be placed into a fanny pack and used while walking.
